# tolowercase
This function can convert a whole string into lowercase unlike tolower() function it doesn't do it character by character instead it takes a whole string and returns it as lowercase which makes is it easier to use

It takes a char * (text) and an empty char * which will later be updated by the function with the lowercase text it uses to lower() function from ctype.h but as we all know its hard to use because it does not take a string(char*) as input nither returns a string(char*) so this function does that for you
